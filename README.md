This repo is an experimental and personal hack against
https://github.com/linebender/xilem. 

## Goals

- Explore how Xilem and/or Masonry might be ported to a terminal UI.
- Help me learn how Xilem and Masonry are designed.
- More exposure to non-trivial Rust code.

## Non-Goals

- Produce something concrete that can be easily foled back into the 
  Xilem project.
- Produce something that other projects should depend on.
